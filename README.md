# mHealthApp

This repository is for the mHealth Mobile Application demo. The demo for the application showcases the required functionality of the mobile application in the complete project. As the functionality of the mobile application was out of scope for our project, we have created this demo that allows the user to receive notifications from the server to showcase what the user experience would be like. The Mobile application demo cannot be used to contact medical assistance in it's current form.

## Implemented Functionality:

- Notifications - The mobile application can receive notifications from the server when a anomalous heart rate was detected.
- Settings - The mobile application has a settings page that can be used to enter the ip address and port number to connect to the server
- UI Design - The mobile application has a dummy User Interface design to help communicate to the user how the application functions.

- Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1 Patch 2
